Project Summary -

The project focuses on predicting credit card payment defaults among customers in Taiwan. Rather than a simple binary classification, the emphasis is on estimating the probability of default. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of credit risk, enhancing risk management practices.

The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including handling missing values, addressing outliers, categorical encoding, and feature engineering. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided crucial insights, revealing correlations between payment history, bill amounts, and default status. Visualizations, such as heatmaps and histograms, were used to identify trends and patterns.

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG Boosting. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were performed to optimize model performance. The final selected model, XG Boosting, demonstrated the highest test accuracy of 85% and an AUC of 0.853.

The K-S chart was employed to evaluate the estimated probability of default. This tool proved invaluable in identifying customers at higher risk of defaulting on their credit card payments, providing a more accurate risk assessment.
